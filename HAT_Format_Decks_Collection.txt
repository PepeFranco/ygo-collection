WIN CONDITION:
Control the board with Hand monster floating effects and Artifact disruption, then win through XYZ monster advantage and grinding out resources

HOW IT WORKS:
- **Fire Hand & Ice Hand:** When one is destroyed, it special summons the other from deck and destroys an opponent's card (Fire destroys monsters, Ice destroys spells/traps)
- **Artifact Engine:** Set Artifact Sanctum, activate during opponent's turn to summon Artifact Moralltach and destroy a card
- **Trap Lineup:** Control the board with 18 traps to prevent opponent from establishing advantage
- **XYZ Monsters:** Make Rank 4 XYZ when you have 2 Level 4 monsters (both Hands are Level 4)

BEGINNER TIPS:
- Fire Hand and Ice Hand create a "loop" - destroying one brings out the other
- Artifact Sanctum should be activated during opponent's turn for surprise destruction
- Use Compulsory Evacuation Device to bounce opponent's monsters
- Number 101 can steal opponent's monsters
- Castel can shuffle problem cards back into deck
- Don't overcommit - this is a grind deck

⚠️ REPLACEMENT NEEDED:

- Replace 3rd with: 1x Madolche Cruffssant OR 1x Maxx "C" for hand traps

WIN CONDITION:
Loop your Madolche monsters back from graveyard to deck, use Madolche Chateau for ATK boost, and use Queen Tiaramisu to shuffle away opponent's cards for non-targeting removal

HOW IT WORKS:
- **Madolche Mechanic:** All Madolche monsters return to deck when destroyed, so you never run out of resources
- **Madolche Chateau:** Field spell gives +500 ATK and returns destroyed Madolche to deck instead of hand
- **Madolche Ticket:** Whenever a Madolche returns to deck, special summon one from deck
- **Combo:** Magileine searches another Madolche, Mewfeuille special summons, make XYZ
- **Tiaramisu:** Detach 2 Madolche XYZ materials to shuffle 2 cards back into opponent's deck (powerful removal)

BEGINNER TIPS:
- Use Magileine to search for the Madolche you need
- Mewfeuille can special summon another Madolche if you control a Madolche
- Always keep Madolche Chateau on field for ATK boost and recursion
- Queen Tiaramisu's shuffle effect doesn't target, so it beats untargetable monsters
- Try to set up Ticket + Chateau for maximum recursion
- Basic combo: Normal Magileine → search Mewfeuille → next turn Normal Mewfeuille → special summon another Madolche → make Rank 4 XYZ

===========================

WIN CONDITION:
Use Traptrix monsters to search and protect Trap Holes, control the board by negating all opponent's plays, then win through XYZ advantage

HOW IT WORKS:
- **Traptrix Monsters:** Immune to Trap Holes and can search/recycle them
- **Traptrix Myrmeleo:** When summoned, destroy 1 spell/trap, then search a "Hole" trap
- **Traptrix Dionaea:** Can special summon itself, and when a Normal Trap activates, can bring back a Traptrix from grave
- **Traptrix Rafflesia:** Rank 4 XYZ that can use Trap Holes from deck by detaching material
- **Strategy:** Search Trap Holes, control opponent's plays, grind advantage

BEGINNER TIPS:
- Traptrix monsters are immune to Bottomless and Trap Hole Nightmare
- Always search the right Trap Hole for the situation:
  - Bottomless: vs summoned monsters 1500+ ATK
  - Trap Hole Nightmare: vs special summons from hand/graveyard
- Traptrix Rafflesia is very powerful - it can activate Trap Holes directly from deck
- This deck is VERY defensive - you win by preventing opponent from playing
- Easiest deck of the three for beginners to HAT format

XYZ SUMMONING TUTORIAL
===========================

**What is XYZ Summoning?**
XYZ monsters are summoned by stacking 2+ monsters of the same level

**How to XYZ Summon:**
1. Have 2 monsters with the same level on field (e.g., 2 Level 4 monsters)
2. Stack them together and place the XYZ monster on top
3. The stacked monsters become "XYZ materials"
4. Use XYZ materials as costs for the XYZ monster's effects

**Example:**
- You control Fire Hand (Level 4) and Ice Hand (Level 4)
- Overlay both to summon Number 101: Silent Honor ARK (Rank 4)
- Number 101 has 2 materials underneath
- Detach 1 material to activate its effect (steal opponent's monster)

**Common Rank 4 XYZ (require 2 Level 4 monsters):**
- **Number 101:** Steal opponent's monsters
- **Castel:** Shuffle cards back to deck
- **Diamond Dire Wolf:** Destroy your card + opponent's card
- **Abyss Dweller:** Prevent opponent from using graveyard effects
