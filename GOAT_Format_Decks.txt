## **DECK BALANCE ANALYSIS**

**GOAT CONTROL:**
- Strengths: Superior card advantage, powerful late game, excellent removal
- Weaknesses: Slower setup, vulnerable to aggressive rushes early

**GOAT BEATDOWN:**
- Strengths: Consistent pressure, hand disruption, faster pace  
- Weaknesses: Less card advantage, weaker to control strategies

These decks create compelling matchups that capture the authentic GOAT format experience, with Control favored in longer games and Beatdown having early game advantages. Both follow the April 2005 banlist restrictions exactly.
