## Deck Matchup Analysis

### Lightsworn vs Quickdraw Plant
- **Lightsworn advantages**: Better late game with Judgment Dragon, more defensive options
- **Quickdraw advantages**: Faster setup, more consistent synchro access, better game 1 speed
- **Key cards**: Book of Moon and Bottomless Trap Hole are crucial in both decks
- **Estimated win rate**: 55-45 in favor of Quickdraw game 1, 50-50 overall

### Key Strategic Considerations

**For Lightsworn Pilot:**
- Manage mills carefully to avoid milling key pieces
- Save Honest for crucial combat phases
- Use Judgment Dragon timing wisely (can clear opponent's synchros)
- Plaguespreader is key for synchro access

**For Quickdraw Pilot:**
- Prioritize getting tuners in hand early
- Use Level Eater and Quillbolt for multiple synchros
- Deep Sea Diva provides consistent Level 4 synchro access
- Don't overextend into backrow

### Edison Format Authenticity
Both decks are completely Edison format legal and represent the core strategies of the format:
- **Synchro summoning** is the primary extra deck mechanic
- **Priority system** interactions with cards like Caius and Gorz
- **Proper power level** with limited card pool (pre-ABPF)
- **Classic Edison staples** like Book of Moon, Brain Control, and Bottomless Trap Hole
- **Balanced gameplay** between aggressive synchro plays and defensive control

These decks capture the essence of Edison format while being perfectly balanced for competitive play against each other using only cards from your collection.
